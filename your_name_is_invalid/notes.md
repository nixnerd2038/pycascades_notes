# Notes
- Encoding standards have different bit-size limits and values, causing encoding issues without conversion
- Knowing the encoding standard of the source text is necessary to proper conversion, especially to systems that don't support thte source
- For characters that can't be converted exception can occur, resulting in ? where unencodeable characters occur
- Helper functions can be used to replace unencodeable characters with similar chars in a map, e.g. `훾` can be converted to `c` with a map to the UTF-8 or ASCII aprpoximate
- Can also use locale libs to convert characters as needed to normalize characters
-  Sorting is problematic due to bitwise sort operation at the lower-level
-  Regex Problems
   -  Example: Regexing `M체nchen` fron `123 M체nchen` can't be done with `re.findall('[a-zA-Z]')`, the `체` is not in the match set, renddering Mnchen as the result
      -  Solved with using `r'\p{L}+'` to catch all non-digit letters
-  `icu` lib preffered for encoding due to multilocale support
